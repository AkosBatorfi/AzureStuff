# AzureStuff

- Start-Stop workflow I made because Azure was too slow stopping and starting VMs in the morning. This makes a parallel startup of VMs possible.
- Formatdisk.ps1 I made to format a disk from an ARM template
- New-ContributorSP.ps1 is a script to create a service principal and giving it contributor rights.
- Get-ASRDetails.ps1 is a script that makes an API call to Azure to retrieve all Azure Site Recovery details (much more than regular PowerShell modules give).
